        The Dullahan is a headless horsemen who carries his head with him at all times. It's said he uses his head to find people who will die soon. It is believed that when his horse stops,
        someone dies. While it is a myth, there are doubts that he was apart of irish tradition. Overall the Dullahan is a pretty medieocre myth.
